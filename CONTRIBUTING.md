# Contributing 

You can submit a pull request. Any pull requests adding additional fruits or lists are welcome from the students in the class. 

Before you submit a change, check the existing issues and pull requests
if they don't already make the change you are submitting.

## Submit pull request

First make sure your name and email are set in your local Git installation:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your@email.com
```

The following steps apply when you never contributed
to the project before.

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. This will create a new repository.
3. Then use Git locally to clone the new repository (aka fork).
4. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b branch-name`).
5. Make changes.
6. Commit the changes.
7. Push the branch (`git push origin branch-name`).
8. Go to the GitHub page of this repository (repository you are contributing to).
9. You should see a new button *Compare & pull request*, use it.
10. Describe the pull request and submit it.
